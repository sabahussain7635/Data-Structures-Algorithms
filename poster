class:bs ai artifical intellgence 

Purpose:
To manage patients in a hospital system  adding, deleting, and displaying patients efficiently.


In a hospital there is a need to store and manage patient records 
Each patient has a unique patient ID, and the hospital must be able to

Add a new patient at the beginning.

Add a new patient at the end.

Add a new patient at a specific position.

Delete a patient from the beginning, end, or a specific position.

Display the list of all patient IDs in order.

A doubly linked list is used to handle these operations easily, as each node can connect both to the next and previous patients.


We will use a classbased approach with two classes:

patient :one patient a node

hospital :manages all patient nodes



















Concept:

A Doubly Linked List connects patients in both directions:

patient class:
it has following members

patient_id

pointer to next patient

pointer to previous patient
--------------------------------


int patient_id;
patient* next;
patient* prev;


---------------------------------

This allows movement forward and backward in the list.

Class hospital:

Manages all patients.

Has a pointer head to the first patient.

we can use hospital class do to many thing like

 Insertion Functions

adding()
Adds a new patient at the start of the list.

addingAtEnd()
Adds a new patient at the end.

addingAposition()
Inserts a new patient at a specific position between patients





 Deletion Functions

deletetbeg() removes the first patient.

deletetend()removes the last patient.

deleteAposition()removes a patient at a specific position.
